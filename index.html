        Maradona displayed football talent early, and at age eight he joined Las Cebollitas (“The Little Onions”), a boys’ 
        team that went on to win 136 consecutive games and a national championship. He signed with Argentinos Juniors at 
        age 14 and made his first-division debut in 1976, 10 days before his 16th birthday. Only four months later he made 
        his debut with the national team, becoming the youngest Argentine ever to do so. 
        Although he was excluded from the 1978 World Cup-winning squad because it was felt that he was still too young, 
        the next year he led the national under-20 team to a Junior World Cup championship.

        A stocky and tenacious midfielder, Maradona became a hero of the lower classes of Argentina (from which he hailed) and of southern Italy, where he led Napoli to victories over the wealthier northern clubs. He played 490 official club games during his 21-year professional career, scoring 259 goals; for Argentina he played 91 games and scored 34 goals. An Internet poll conducted by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association named Maradona the top player of the 20th century.

        In 2008 Maradona was named head coach of the Argentine national team. Shortly after leading Argentina to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup, he and the country’s football governing body could not agree on a contract extension, and his tenure as the team’s head coach ended. In 2011 Maradona was hired to coach the United Arab Emirates club Al Wasl. However, the team struggled, and Maradona was fired the following year. He worked for several other clubs before becoming coach of Mexico’s Dorados de Sinaloa in 2018.
